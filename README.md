# Work Day Planner

## Description
The work day planner this is a simple calendar application that lets you plan your work day. The app displays a standard daily schdule, informs the user of the current date, and allows him or her to save events by hour. For the purposes of the app, saved events are cleared from local storage whenever the user accesses the planner on subsequent days (the planner is intended to work for only one day and is new every day). The timeblocks for each hour are helpfully color-coded according to past, present and future relative to the current moment **(for full functionality, please view the app between the hours of 9am and 6pm!)**.

The work day planner application can be accessed here: https://angelagongli.github.io/work-day-planner
